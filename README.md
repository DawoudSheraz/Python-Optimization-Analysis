NOTE: All the scripts are compatbile only with Python 3.6. To run them on Python 2.7, the modifications will be required.

      Python provides with the various data structures, with famous examples of list, dictionary, set and tuple. One of the major aspect of the python data structures is the ease of getting things done. Each data structure provides features that are easy to use. e.g. to search any key inside a dictionary, an operator of "in" is used. However, when we talk about in term of performance, not all data structures prove to be useful. This repository will provide with different scripts, that apply various operations in accordance to different data structres and save the resultant data in csv files.
 
 ---- From This point, each script in the main folder will be explained.
